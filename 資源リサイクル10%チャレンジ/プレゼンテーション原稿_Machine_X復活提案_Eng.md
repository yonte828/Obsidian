## 【Slide 1】Title Slide 
0:32

Good evening, everyone. Thank you very much for your time today.

We from Company B would like to present two strategic proposals regarding the future of Company A's products.

The title is "Strategic Mobilization Proposal for Company A Products." Through these two proposals, we hope to help accelerate Company A's mobility transformation.

---

## 【Slide 2】Important Notice
0:25

First, let me share an important context with you.

This proposal has been driven by the enthusiasm of Company B's Challenge Activity Project members. While this is not yet an official decision by Company B, we project members are fully committed to making this proposal a reality.

---

## 【Slide 3】Overview of Two Strategic Proposals
2:03

Now, let me explain the two strategies we are proposing today.

**First, Proposal 1: "Technical Support for Mobility Transformation."**

This proposal aims to achieve early mobility transformation of Company A products through specialized technical assistance and know-how provision from Company B. Specifically, we will provide comprehensive know-how for mobilization, enhance the reliability of Company A products, and accelerate your mobility transformation.

Regarding this proposal, Company A has already come to us.  
In particular, you have shown interest in using our undercarriage technology, and we would like to move this forward.

**And what we'd especially like to focus on today is Proposal 2: "The Machine X Revival Project."**

This is a proposal for strategic market entry based on a proven platform.  
By refreshing the Machine X mobile crusher platform, you can quickly enter the market.

Through these two proposals, we aim to drive transformation through technical synergy and strategic revival, creating value for both Company A and Company B.

## 【Slide 4】Proposal 1: Technical Support for Mobilization
0:56

Let me briefly explain Proposal 1.

**The value proposition is "Bringing World-Class Undercarriage Quality to Company A Products."**

As I mentioned earlier, Company A has already reached out to us about using our undercarriage technology.  
So we would like to move this collaboration forward and support the mobilization of Company A products with Company B’s proven components.

Company B's undercarriage technology has decades of history, proven durability, and has become the global standard used in construction and mining equipment worldwide.

---

## 【Slide 5】Benefits for Company A: Reliability and Speed
1:04

There are two major benefits for Company A from this proposal.

**First is "Immediate Availability."** 

By providing the necessary undercarriage technology early on, we can simplify the development process and ensure a smooth launch. This shortens your development timeline.

**Second is "Proven Quality."**

We can quickly deliver Company B's quality, which has been tested in harsh environments around the world, to Company A's customers. We provide globally proven reliability.

Since discussions have already begun regarding Proposal 1, I'll keep this overview brief and move on to main topic of this presentation, Proposal 2.

## 【Slide 6】Proposal 2: Is It Time to Revive Machine X?
1:19

Now, this is the core of this presentation.

**"Is it time to revive Machine X?"**

This is our strategic proposal.

**First, let me explain the current status of Machine X.**

Machine X is a mobile crusher with a proven track record and a strong market reputation. However, its production has currently ended due to profitability considerations, creating a significant vacancy in Company C Group’s product lineup.

In other words, this is a "dormant asset ready for action."

**So here is our proposal.**

We propose a complete technology transfer to revive this machine. This will provide you with a market-ready solution that can immediately strengthen and expand Company A's product portfolio.

Immediate market entry　—this is the key point.

## 【Slide 7】Why Now? Overcoming Past Barriers
3:24

You might be wondering, "But why now?"

Actually, we can turn past challenges and current dilemmas into new opportunities through partnership.

**First, what were the past challenges?**

In the past, Company B had a limited crusher lineup, which made it hard for us to compete as a full-solution provider.

In addition, the strong yen hurt profitability, and we eventually had to exit the market.

**So what is the current issue?**

To be honest, Company B currently does not have a dedicated mobile crusher team, and we cannot allocate resources. While we really want to revive this product, we haven’t been able to do so because of limited internal resources.

**However, there is a new opportunity here.**

That opportunity is a partnership with Company A.

Company A has expertise in the North American market and a rich crusher lineup.

In other words, **Company B's technological intellectual property and Company A's development team = Powerful synergy**, making the revival of Machine X possible.

Past challenges can be solved through partnership.

---

## 【Slide 8】A "Win-Win-Win" Project
1:08

This project is truly a "three-way benefit"—a "Win-Win-Win" project.

We create shared value for all stakeholders through strategic synergy.

**What is the Win for Company A?**

You can launch competitive products with minimal risk and investment. You can maximize speed to market.

**What is the Win for Company B?**

We can make valuable, underutilized dormant technological assets shine in the market again with the help of a trusted partner.

**And what is the Win for the Group as a whole?**

We expand the product portfolio, generate significant synergies, and increase profits.

This project benefits all parties involved—that's the key feature.

## 【Slide 9】What We Can Provide: "Project Starter Kit"
1:13

You might be thinking, "But starting from scratch would be difficult, wouldn't it?"

This is not starting from zero. We provide a complete package.

**There are three things we can provide.**

**First, proven design data.**

We will provide the full set of Machine X design drawings and related specification documents, ready for immediate use.

**Second, extensive know-how.**

We provide access to a practical knowledge base including historical defect cases and established countermeasures. This allows you to proceed smoothly with development without repeating the same mistakes.

**Third, technical support.**

We, the project members, will lead the technology transfer and provide hands-on support.

In other words, you have a complete "Project Starter Kit" ready to go.

## 【Slide 13：Technical Know-how Provision】

Let me briefly explain what we can actually provide from a technical perspective.

With over 30 years of experience in mobile crusher design, Company B has accumulated extensive technical know-how.  
And through this partnership, we are ready to share that know-how with you.

There are five key elements.

**Design standards, FEA analysis, Testing standards, Defect case database, Experienced engineers.**  
In the next slide, I’ll show you some concrete examples.


---
## 【Slide 14：Technical Know-how Provision】

This is an example of our design standards.

Here you can see how our crusher-related standards have been converted into KES and fully organized.  
We also use standardized quality confirmation sheets, like this example for jaw crusher crushing capacity.

---
## 【Slide 15：Technical Know-how Provision】

This slide shows our FEA analysis and testing standards.

We have performed a large number of FEA analyses in past projects, and each analysis can be reviewed by number, including conditions and results.  
In addition, we have 38 dedicated test standards for mobile crushers, along with other standards shared with excavator development.

---
## 【Slide 16：Technical Know-how Provision】

Finally, this is our defect case database.

We maintain a searchable collection of past defect cases and implemented countermeasures, making it easy to learn from previous issues.  
During design release, drawings are also checked against a standardized checklist.

---
## 【Slide 17】Next Steps: Hop, Step, Jump
0:52

Now, regarding how we will proceed with the next steps.

We're thinking of this in three phases: "Hop, Step, Jump."

**First, "Hop"—establishing the joint plan. This is what we should do today and through the next several meetings.**

**Next, "Step"—Feasibility study execution. This will be the work for the following months.**

**And then "Jump"—full development. This is our future goal.**

Let's move toward achieving our goals through these steps.

Let's start with "Hop"—establishing the joint plan.

## 【Slide 11】Q&A Session
0:52

Thank you for your attention.

The two strategies we have proposed today, especially the Machine X Revival Project, can create a significant market impact by combining the strengths of Company A and Company B. We are confident of this.

That’s all from my side. I’d be happy to answer any questions or comments.
